# QR Code Reader for Windows
### Basic AF QR Code Reader I copy + pasted together at work for a staff requirement

forked project and made some small modifications

## Credit Where is definitely Due
This was made using the ZXing library for the QR decoding which you can find over at https://github.com/zxing/zxing

And

The live webcam feed and processing is thanks to the AForge Framework over at http://www.aforgenet.com

## Usage

Run it...

At the moment it supports only 2 QR Code types, URL encoded and Text encoded. I'm certain the libary includes all formats, feel free to customise to suit.

## Example
```
/me double clicks exe file
```
